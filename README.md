### Frameworks, Libraries, and Programs Used

1. GitHub:
   - GitHub is used to store the project codes after being pushed from Codeanywhere.
2. Git:
   - Git is used for version control, to enable commits to Git and the ability to Push to GitHub.
3. Google Fonts:
   - Google Fonts was used throughout the website, for aesthetic purposes in regards to the text.

## Testing

The project was validated using JSHint and the W3C Markup Validator, in order to ensure that the project contained no errors.

[JSHint - Results](assets/images/jshint_results.png)

[W3C Markup Validator - Results](assets/images/w3c_validator_results.png)

[W3C CSS Validator - Results](assets/images/w3c_css_validator_results.png)

The first images for the answers did not want to load when previewing the website. This was a quick fix, as the file pathway was written incorrectly.
JSHint flagged an unnecessary semi-colon on ln69, which has since been removed, and the W3C CSS Validator noted a padding value error which had been left in on ln27, again, this has since been removed.

With more time, I would like to add more questions and a fully functioning scoreboard with current scores. Also, a possibility of adding more quizes to give the user a range of options when they visit the site.
